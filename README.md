👋 Greetings! I'm Dibyendu Ghosh, a tech aficionado and ambitious IT engineering student currently completing my degree at Heritage Institute of Technology. Armed with a solid programming foundation—especially in Java, React, and Express—I'm eager to bring my skills to the forefront of the tech landscape.

🚀 Recently, I wrapped up a stimulating student internship at NIT Durgapur (sponsored by DRDO-CAIR), where I delved into the realms of open-source technologies. The project, "Performance Evaluation of Open-Source LID, Speaker Diarization, and Speech Enhancement Algorithm," not only added valuable experience to my repertoire but also heightened my passion for pushing technological boundaries.

💡 My dedication extends to ongoing projects, including my final year endeavor, the "Smart Attendance System." Leveraging multiple face recognition techniques, this project aims to revolutionize attendance tracking, suitable for both office environments and classrooms.

🛠️ Beyond coursework, I actively contribute to projects such as the "To Do App with Server" and "Find My Service." These ventures showcase my proficiency in the MERN stack, where I prioritize user-friendly interfaces and seamless user experiences.

👨‍💻 Skill-wise, I bring expertise in the MERN stack, Java, C, Python (for Data Analytics), RDBMS, and comprehensive knowledge of data structures and algorithms.

⚙️ My commitment to technology doesn't end with code. I find joy in collaborating on open-source initiatives and continually expanding my horizons.

📬 Let's connect! Reach out to me at dibyendu.ghosh.pvt@gmail.com or connect on LinkedIn. I'm always open to exciting collaborations, discussions, or just a chat about our favorite coding challenges.

Happy coding! 🚀✨
